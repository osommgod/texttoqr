      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the QR Generator Pro website, application and API (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account, subscribing to a plan, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Account Registration</h2>

        <li>You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into a legally binding contract.</li>
        <li>You agree to provide accurate and complete information during registration and to keep your account details up to date.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may use the Service to generate QR codes and process conversions in accordance with your selected plan.</li>
        <li>You must not use the Service for any unlawful, harmful, fraudulent, misleading or abusive purpose.</li>
        <li>You must not use QR codes generated via the Service in connection with: malware, phishing, scams, hate speech, harassment, illicit drugs, weapons, or any content that violates applicable laws or the policies of our payment partners.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or expose us or our payment processors to risk.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Plans, Billing and Payments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or yearly, as specified at checkout) through our payment processors such as Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay or PayU.</li>
        <li>By starting a subscription, you authorize us and our payment partners to charge your selected payment method for the applicable fees, taxes and any overage charges as described in the pricing page.</li>
        <li>Invoices and payment confirmations will be sent to the email address associated with your account.</li>
        <li>If a payment fails, we may retry charges and, if necessary, suspend or limit access to the Service until payment is successfully processed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard or by contacting support. Cancellation will stop future renewals; you will retain access until the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li>Our general refund rules are described in the <a href="/legal/refund">Refund Policy</a>. Certain promotional or custom enterprise agreements may be non‑refundable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Fair Use and Limits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each plan includes a defined monthly conversion and API usage limit. Excessive or abusive usage that significantly exceeds normal patterns may result in temporary rate limits or a request to upgrade your plan.</li>
        <li>We may implement technical limits to protect the stability of the Service and the infrastructure of our payment partners.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Service, including the software, design, logos and trademarks, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual‑property laws.</li>
        <li>You retain ownership of the content and data you submit to generate QR codes. You grant us a limited license to process that content solely for the purpose of providing the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Service Modifications</h2>
      <p>We may modify, suspend or discontinue features of the Service from time to time, including changes required by security, legal or payment‑gateway requirements. Where changes materially affect your use of the Service, we will provide reasonable notice via email or in‑app notifications.</p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non‑infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free operation of the Service.</p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Service will be limited to the amount you paid for the Service in the 3 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data or business opportunities.</p>

      <h2>10. Compliance and Cooperation with Payment Gateways</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use the Service in a way that causes us or our payment partners to violate applicable card‑network, bank or financial‑services rules. We may share necessary transaction information with our payment processors for fraud‑prevention, dispute management and regulatory compliance.</p>

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may stop using the Service at any time. Deleting your account will result in loss of access to your data, subject to our data‑retention obligations.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate your account if you materially breach these Terms, fail to pay fees when due, or use the Service in a way that could harm other users, third parties or our payment partners.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>Unless otherwise required by law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which our operating entity is established, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws principles. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction.</p>

      <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the updated Terms constitutes your acceptance.</p>
