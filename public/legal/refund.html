      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p>This Refund Policy explains when you may be eligible for a refund for purchases made through QR Generator Pro.
        Our aim is to be fair to customers while also preventing abuse and complying with requirements from payment
        gateways and financial partners.</p>

      <h2>1. Subscription Billing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All paid plans are billed in advance for the selected billing period (monthly or yearly).</li>
        <li>Charges are non‑refundable except as explicitly described in this policy or where required by applicable
          law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Free Trial and Evaluation</h2>
      <p>We may offer a free tier or trial period so that you can evaluate the Service before upgrading to a paid plan.
        We strongly recommend testing the Service during this period to ensure it meets your needs.</p>

      <h2>3. Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
      <p>Subject to the conditions below, we may issue a partial or full refund in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Duplicate payment:</strong> you were charged more than once for the same subscription due to a
          technical error.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized transaction:</strong> you did not authorize the charge and you notify us promptly after
          discovering it.</li>
        <li><strong>Service not delivered:</strong> prolonged outages or issues fully attributable to us that prevented
          reasonable use of the Service and could not be resolved within a reasonable time after you reported them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Non‑Refundable Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Change of mind after successful use of the Service during the billing period.</li>
        <li>Failure to cancel before the renewal date. When you cancel, your subscription remains active until the end
          of the current period but is not renewed.</li>
        <li>Usage that violates our <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a> or acceptable‑use guidelines.</li>
        <li>Fees paid to third parties (for example, bank charges, currency‑conversion fees or taxes) that are outside
          our control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>
      <p>If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please contact us within 14 days of the charge by emailing <a
          href="mailto:billing@text2qr.online">billing@text2qr.online</a> and include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the email address associated with your account,</li>
        <li>the invoice ID or transaction reference,</li>
        <li>a brief description of the issue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may request additional information to verify your identity and investigate the transaction. Approved refunds
        will be processed to the original payment method where possible. Processing times depend on your bank or card
        issuer.</p>

      <h2>6. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
      <p>If you initiate a chargeback through your bank or card issuer, we may suspend or terminate your account while
        the dispute is being investigated. We encourage you to contact us first so we can try to resolve the issue
        directly.</p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Refund Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our business or requirements from
        payment processors and card networks. The latest version will always be available on this page.</p>

      <p class="muted">This policy is designed to give payment gateways and users a clear understanding of how refunds
        are handled. It does not replace any mandatory rights you may have under local consumer‑protection laws.</p>
