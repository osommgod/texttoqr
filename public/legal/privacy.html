          details you provide when signing up.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing information</strong>: billing address, VAT/GST details (if applicable) and payment method
          details processed securely by our payment partners (such as Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay or PayU). We do not store
          full card numbers or CVV codes on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Service usage data</strong>: generated QR codes, number of conversions, plan type, API keys, and
          basic logs (timestamps, IP address, user‑agent) for security and anti‑fraud purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Support communication</strong>: information you send to us via email or contact forms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>Your information is used for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your account and subscriptions.</li>
        <li>To process payments, issue invoices and detect fraudulent activity.</li>
        <li>To provide, maintain and improve the QR code generator, dashboard and API.</li>
        <li>To send important service‑related emails (billing notices, security alerts, service changes).</li>
        <li>To provide customer support and respond to your requests.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations, including tax and accounting requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <p>For users in the EU/EEA and UK, we process personal data on the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract</strong>: to provide the services you subscribe to.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong>: to secure our platform, prevent fraud and improve our services.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>We use essential cookies to keep you logged in and to secure your session. We may use analytics tools to
        understand service usage in aggregate. You can control cookies through your browser settings, but disabling
        essential cookies may affect core functionality.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with trusted third parties only when necessary:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment processors for handling subscription payments and fraud screening.</li>
        <li>Cloud hosting and infrastructure providers that store our databases and logs.</li>
        <li>Customer support and email delivery tools used to communicate with you.</li>
        <li>Professional advisors (lawyers, accountants) where legally required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All third‑party providers are bound by data‑processing agreements and are required to protect your data.</p>

      <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your data may be processed in data centers located outside your country. Where required, we rely on standard
        contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards to ensure an adequate level of protection.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We keep your account data for as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period afterward to comply
        with legal, tax and accounting requirements. QR conversion logs and technical logs may be retained for a shorter
        period for security and analytics, after which they are anonymized or deleted.</p>
